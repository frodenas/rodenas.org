If you plan to attend to the [Qcon conference][1] in London, UK, on March 12-16th 2007, you could get a 50GPD discount using the special promotional code **javabloggers** when you register.

And also, you could get a chance to win a \*free\* 5 day conference pass, writing an entry in your blog that mentions and links to [QCon][1] (like this one ðŸ˜‰ ).

More info at [Simon Brown blog][2].

**Updated 01/28/2007**: Today, I have registered for the conference. I will try to live blog this event.
