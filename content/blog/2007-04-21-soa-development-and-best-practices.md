[IBM developerWorks][1] has released a preview of its new [SOA development and best practices][2] page, a space that gives developers, architects and decision-makers a variety of technical content &#8211; articles, tutorials, workshops and interactive community tools &#8211; that help with <acronym title="Service Oriented Architecture">SOA</acronym> development, implementation and management.

And if you want to stay tuned with recent SOA adoptions, subscribe to the [IBM SOA Newsletter][3], where [Sandy Carter][4], IBM VP in charge of IBM&#8217;s SOA and WebSphere strategy, talks every month about everything you need to know about Service Oriented Architecture.

BTW, congratulations to Michael O&#8217;Connell and all of the <acronym title="developerWorks">dW</acronym> team for their recent [Jolt Hall of Fame award][5].
