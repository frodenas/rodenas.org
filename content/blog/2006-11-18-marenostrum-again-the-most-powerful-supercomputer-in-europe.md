The [Marenostrum supercomputer][1] has doubled its calculation capacity, up to 94.21 Tflops/s, and now it’s the 5th largest system worldwide and, again, the first in Europe, as appeared at the [28th TOP500 Supercomputer Sites List][2] released during the [2006 Super Computing Conference][3] in November.

I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to see the MareNostrum supercomputer during a visit to the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center][4] this year, and it’s fantastic to behold its unusual home, a former stone chapel built in the 1920’s, the [Torre Girona chapel][5]. You could see some photos at the [BSC Gallery][6].
