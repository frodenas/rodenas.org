Four volunteers from four different countries accepted the [JavaTools][1] challenge of using a different IDE for 30 Days. Two [Eclipse][2] fans lived the life of a NetBeans fan for 30 Days. At the same time, two [NetBeans][3] fans lived the life of an Eclipse fan for 30 Days. [Here][4] are their journals during the experiment and their final interviews. If you ever thought about moving to another IDE, their stories will give you some interesting information.
