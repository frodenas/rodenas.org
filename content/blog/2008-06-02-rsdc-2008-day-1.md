Exhausted after my first day at [RSDC][1], so just a quick note.

Yesterday, my flight from JFK to MCO was delayed 3 hours and I arrived to Orlando too late. As I had a meeting earlier this morning, I haven&#8217;t slept much last night. Anyway, this morning I felt energized. I finally met [Kelly][2] and some of the Jazz guys, [Bill][3] and [Patrick][4], in our first Blogger/Tweetup at the Dolphin Bar. And I got my very exclusive Rational Suport Moo Card!

Oh, and if you hear some rumors that I&#8217;m appearing at the WebSphere Rocks! cover magazine dressed like a guitar hero, it&#8217;s not true! Forget it!
