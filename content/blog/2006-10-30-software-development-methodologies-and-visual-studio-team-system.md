[Sanjay Narang][1] has published a new article on [MSDN][2] about [automating a life-cyle methodology in VSTS][3]. Here is the summary: 

> There is a diverse set of methodologies for different types of software-development life cycles. To implement these methodologies effectively and consistently, it is important to have life-cycle tools that automate the processes and artifacts of the methodologies. Microsoft Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) provides a compelling solution for methodology management and automation.
