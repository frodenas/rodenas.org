Via [Mainframe Watch Belgium][1], I discover [The Mainframe Guru][2], a little quiz from [CA][3] that lets you know your mainframe knowledge.

BTW, on November 5, I will attend the Amsterdam [GSE European Working Group: European Enterprise Modernization for zOS][4], so if you are a reader of this blog and you will also attend to this meeting, stop by and say hello.
