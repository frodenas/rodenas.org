I get a copy of the last [The Architecture Journal][1], by [Microsoft][2], obtained by my manager at the [Microsoft Strategic Architect Forum (SAF)][3].

This issue is focused on “[Software Factories][4]” (I don&#8217;t like this name, it could be confusing) and it has nice articles that explains some experiences with <acronym title="Domain Specific Languages">DSL</acronym> and how to fit into the software factories methodology. One of the articles is from [Jack Greenfield][5], co-author of [Software Factories: Assembling Applications with Patterns, Models, Frameworks, and Tools][6].
