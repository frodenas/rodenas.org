Did you find too difficult to download what you needed from the Eclipse web site? Try the new [draft download page][1] and give some feedback to the [Eclipse Packaging Project][2] via [bugzilla][3].

The new download page maps to four user profiles and packages:

  1. Java Developers: The essential tools for any Java developer, including a Java IDE, a CVS client, XML Editor and Mylar.
  2. Java Enterprise Developers: Tools for Java developers creating JEE and Web applications, including a Java IDE, tools for JEE and JSF, Mylar and others.
  3. C/C++ Developers: An IDE for C/C++ developers.
  4. RCP/Plugin Developers: A complete set of tools for developers who want to create Eclipse plug-ins or Rich Client Applications. It includes a complete SDK, developer tools and source code.

And remember, the new [Eclipse Europa][4] will be released this month!</a>
