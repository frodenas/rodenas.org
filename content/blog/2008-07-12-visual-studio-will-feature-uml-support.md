As I wrote in a [previous post][1], one of the main problems I saw in [Microsoft Visual Studio][2] <acronym title="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</acronym> Tools was the lack of support for <acronym title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</acronym>. I’m not a big fan of UML, but I must recognize that a common modeling language could be helpful in some scenarios.

Now, it seems that Microsoft changed it&#8217;s view. Bill Gates [announced][3] at [Tech·Ed 2008 for Developers][4] that UML will be part of Visual Studio 10. Great news. But this announce does not means that Microsoft is moving away from DSL. As [Cameron Skinner][5] wrote in a [post][6], Microsoft will be using an hybrid model, a combination of both approaches: UML at the &#8220;logical&#8221; layer and DSLs at the &#8220;physical&#8221; layer. Not as powerful as [openArchitectureWare][7], but a great step forward.
