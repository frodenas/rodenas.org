[LogicaCMG][1] has created a new site, called [EPF Wiki][2], aimed to contain free software process descriptions, created using the [Eclipse Process Framework (EPF)][3] Composer, that everyone can edit using [Wiki][4] technology.

> EPF Wiki is Wiki technology designed to be used together with Eclipse Process Framework (EPF). This offers the best of two distinct worlds: the worlds of powerful process frameworks and Wikis. It offers an process engineering infrastructure that combines a modular method construction approach and the flexibility and ease of use that is the defining characteristic of a Wiki.
> 
> EPF Wiki is an innovation that adds Wiki features to the hypertext process descriptions created with EPF Composer.

There is a discussion in [epf-dev maillist][5] about how Wikis can be accepted as a means of contributing as expected by the Eclipse organization, similar to [Bugzilla][6] and the official [discussions lists][7].

This new site is considered an unofficial EPF community site, as this technology is still under Eclipse Legal Review, and it is not available as a download. It is planned to become available in the third quarter of 2007.
