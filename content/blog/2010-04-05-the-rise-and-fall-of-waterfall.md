Though a little like flying a Cessna with a 747&#8217;s checklist, perhaps the free wiki based open-source technology systems and software development life cycle over at <a href="http://OpenSDLC.org" rel="nofollow">http://OpenSDLC.org</a> is worth checking out as a starting-point, even better still it&#8217;s creative commons so it&#8217;s free to copy, paste, edit and use &#8230;or for just under a hundred bucks you can get all the original files and tweak them to suit your collective needs.
