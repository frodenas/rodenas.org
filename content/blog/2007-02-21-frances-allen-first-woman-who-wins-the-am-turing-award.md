She is an Advisory Council Member of the [Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology][5], whose goal is to increase the participation of women in all aspects of technology. She also received the first Anita Borg Award for Technical Leadership, which was presented at [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing][6] in 2004.
