Ever wonder which is the recipe [YouTube][1] applied for a handling rapid growth? Just ran this loop many times a day:
  
`<br />
 while (true)<br />
{<br />
identify_and_fix_bottlenecks();<br />
drink();<br />
sleep();<br />
notice_new_bottleneck();<br />
}<br />
` 

Now seriously, a new site, called [High Scalability][2], has been recently launched trying to bring together all the lore, art, science, practice, and experience of building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how to build your system with confidence. It has lots of useful information, as [books][3], [products][4], [papers][5], a [glossary][6], and a number of [Real Life Architectures][7], such as the architectures for [Amazon][8], [eBay][9], [Google][10] or [YouTube][11] among others.
