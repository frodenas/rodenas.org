There is a new useful article at [EclipseZone][1] about the differences between Eclipse Extension Registry and OSGi Services. The article describes in general terms some of the strengths and weaknesses of these two models, and makes some suggestions about making a choice.

If you are interested in this topic, read the full article at [A Comparison of Eclipse Extensions and OSGi Services][2].

<acronym title="By The Way">BTW</acronym>, seems that the ubiquitous [Spring framework][3] and it&#8217;s [OSGi][4] support has got a lot of [attention][5] in the last months, and this article is not an exception.
