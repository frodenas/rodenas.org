It&#8217;s a bit old, but I discovered these links today. Phil Haack collected together in a post [19 Eponymous Laws Of Software Development][1], and Joey deVilla, inspired by Phil&#8217;s article, collected more laws, axioms and rules pertaining to mainstream software development and put them in a nice, easy-to-read table in [Laws of Software Development][2].

My personal favorite is the [Conwayâ€™s Law][3]:

> Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

Which is your personal favorite law?
