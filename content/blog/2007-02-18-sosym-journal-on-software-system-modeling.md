I have discovered another interesting online publication: [The Journal of Software and Systems Modeling][1] (SoSyM).

> Software and System Modeling (SoSyM) is an English language quarterly international journal that focuses on theoretical and practical issues pertaining to the development and application of software and system modeling languages and techniques. The aim of the journal is to publish high-quality works that further understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of modeling languages and techniques, present rigorous analyses of modeling experiences, and present scalable modeling techniques and processes that facilitate rigorous and economical development of software.
> 
> The following are some of the topic areas that are of special interest:
> 
>   * Methodological issues
>   * Model-based testing techniques
>   * Development of modeling standards
>   * Formal syntax and semantics of modeling languages such as the UML
>   * Rigorous model-based analysis
>   * Model composition and transformation
>   * Metamodeling techniques
>   * Measuring quality of models
>   * Modeling support for aspect-oriented development
>   * Ontological approaches to model engineering
>   * Generating test and code artifacts from models
>   * Model development tool environments
>   * Case studies and experience reports with significant modeling lessons learned
>   * Comparative analyses of modeling languages and techniques
>   * Scientific assessment of modeling practices

Check the list of articles at [Springer][2], you will see well-known authors, as [Ivar Jacobson][3], [Alan W. Brown][4] and [Grady Booch][5] among others.

Actually they have two Call for Papers for Theme Issues: [Metamodeling][6] and [Model-Based Systems Engineering with SysML, UML, and OWL][7].

The biggest failing with some of todayâ€™s corporate executives is that they do not understand the inherent waste that occurs when an SDLC system is not in place. This includes declining inter-departmental moral, expanded time lines, and use of costly resources like I.T. contractors. In fact, not spending the capital and time needed upfront within a companies I.T. department, costs actually increase with most of drain coming from employee turnovers and overtime costs.
