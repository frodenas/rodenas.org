Microsoft is providing a free training kit for partners, consultants and customers with a complete overview and illustration of the Visual Studio Team System tools platform using a real?world sample application and following the Basic Maturity Level of Microsoft&#8217;s Application Platform Optimization Initiative (APOI) model.

The [3-Day SDLC-in-a-Box training program][1] provides a hands?on view into the building of a real?world, sample application, using realistic team roles and work items assignments. The program not only explains the Visual Studio Team System and Team Foundation Server products, but walks through the creation of a sample application from Requirements to Testing & Build Automation.
