Martin Fowler is talking about [how to improve the productivity of software developers][1]:

> An answer I&#8217;ve given regularly for many years now, and one that applies to almost anyone who uses a computer, is give them a bigger screen.

> These days I say that everyone should have at least two 20 inch screens.

You need more arguments, see [the 30-inch Apple Cinema HD Display study][2], by [Pfeiffer Consulting][3] and sponsored by [Apple][4], which states that providing employees with 30-in. computer monitors can boost worker productivity at companies where 17- or 19-in. monitors are typically used (BTW, this study was fiercely criticized by [Jacob Nielsen][5] in a recent post titled [Productivity and Screen Size][6]).
