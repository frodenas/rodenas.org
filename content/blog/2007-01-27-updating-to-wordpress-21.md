I have just updated this blog to the newest version of WordPress, the [&#8220;Ella (2.1)&#8221;][1] version. The process is very simple: backup the WP database, turn off all plugins, delete old files, upload new files and run the upgrade.php script.

The only fear that I have had was the plugin compatibility, so I checked the [WordPress Plugin compatibility list][2] to ensure that all of the plugins that I use in this blog will work with the new version. I discovered that not all of the plugins were listed in the compatibility list, so I then turn these on one by one and test my blog to see if it works. As I usually maintain my plugins updated, I didn&#8217;t have any problems.

BTW, this is the plugin list:

  * [Add Meta Tags 0.9][3]
  * [Akismet 2.0][4]
  * [Customizable Post Listing 1.1][5]
  * [Feedburner Feed Replacement 2.2][6]
  * [Google (XML) Sitemaps 3.0b6][7]
  * [Live Comment Preview 1.7][8]
  * [Optimal Title 2.0][9]
  * [Popularity Contest 1.2.1][10]
  * [Related Posts 2.0.4][11]
  * [time2read 20/10/04][12]
  * [WordPress Database Backup 2.0][13]
  * [WordPress Heat Map 1.1][14]
  * [WordPress Mobile Edition 2.0][15]
  * [wp-cache 2.0.22][16]
  * [WP-ContactForm 1.4.3][17]
  * [WP-SlimStat 0.9.2][18]



I have also changed the blog feed to point to [FeedBurner][19]. If you were subscribed to this blog, you must not notice this change, as the [Feedburner Feed Replacement][6] plugin will forward all of the feed traffic to FeedBurner. But if you prefer to subscribe directly, change you subscription to point at <http://feeds.feedburner.com/SdlcBlog>.
