A two weeks-old news, but very important in the IDE arena.

According to a [Evans Data Winter 2006 EMEA Development Survey][1] (almost 400 developers ), &#8220;the adoption rate of [Eclipse][2] has more than doubled in the <acronym title="Europe, the Middle East and Asia">EMEA</acronym> region, making it the first IDE to challenge [Microsoft Visual Studio.NET][3] among developers there&#8221;.

John Andrews, [Evans Data][4] president, told that “Microsoft has dominated languages since the early ’90s, but we are seeing much more parity now”. Anyway, Visual Studio is the de facto IDE for most engineers, despite it&#8217;s [dramatic erosion][5].
