Thanks to [Alan Lepofsky][1], today I discovered some interesting buildings at the IBM 12 islands at [Second Life][2] (more info at the [eightbar team][3] blog).

Alan, who acted as a host, guided us through some of the key spots:

He also shows us how to take the train tour, who flies around the IBM complex:

And surprise! After the tour, I discovered an [IBM System 360][4] replica:

I think this kind of initiatives has an enormous potential, despite some negative commentary about the early of this technology. Related to the financial sector (the one where I&#8217;m actually working on), I hope we will see in brief some bank branch offices openings, as the [ABN AMRO branch opening][5].
