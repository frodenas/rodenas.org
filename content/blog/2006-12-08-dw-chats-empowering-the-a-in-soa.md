Just finished another [developerWorks][1] chat, this time conducted by [Grady Booch][2] and helped by Brian Bryson (ASQ) and Steve Weaver (ADC), about [Empowering the A in SOA][3].

Grady started with a magisterial class warning that <acronym title="Service-Oriented Architecture">SOA</acronym> is not the acronym of [Snake Oil-oriented Architecture][4] but something like a message-passing pattern, where he distinguish it with a big S and a little s: the big S being classic web services and little s being true services offered up by a system as manifest in a set of <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">APIs</acronym> that let you pass messages/objects and initiate/derive some behaviour from that system. He emphasizes the A in SOA, being good architectures a fundamental factor. Sound architecture &#8211; and the processes that lead to that architecture &#8211; is a precursor to having SOA used properly.

About the organizational concerns, he recommends us James O. Coplien&#8217;s book [Organizational Patterns of Agile Software Development][5].

About the latest [Rational toolset release][6] (codename Caspian), he told us that the modelling tools focuses on modelling of services, because, among other things, semantics of the messages that are passed are a significant design decision. He also told us that Rational has made the architectural decision to base all of their desktop-facing tools on the eclipse platform (a well-engineering foundation for the developer experience).

If you are more interested about the contents of this chat, you can read the [transcript][7]. (**Updated**)
