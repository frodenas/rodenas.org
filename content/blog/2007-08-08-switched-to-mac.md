Haven&#8217;t had time to write about it, still, better late than never.

I have always heard positive experiences from people switching to Mac. Last month, forced by the slowing down of my [Acer TravelMate 290][1] laptop and encouraged by [Andy Piper][2] and [Eneko Alonso][3], who had blogged their recent switching experiences, I finally bought a 15‚Äù [MacBook Pro][4] and a [Mighty Mouse][5] from Apple.

Despite there is always a bit of a learning curve involved (I have had some minor issues due to Windows-Mac equivalent keys, as the Print Screen, Control and Command, and Alt and Options keys), I found the move very easy. Setting up Mac OS X is really simple, and the user interface behavior is terrific. I have also found the blogosphere as a very valuable aid for switchers, as it is plenty of useful tips and hints. I recommend you [How to Switch to the Mac][6] and Andy Piper&#8217;s [Mac posts][7].

After playing with some applications that I have found at some Mac specialized web sites as [MacUpdate][8], here is the list of them that I have installed so far:

  * [Adium][9] (free): instant messaging application for Mac OS X that can connect to AIM, MSN, Jabber, Yahoo, and more.
  * [Eclipse][10] (free): the essential IDE.
  * [Firefox][11] (free): the essential open-source browser.
  * [Flickr Uploadr][12] (free): to upload your photos to [Flickr][13].
  * [Flip4mac WMC Player][14] (free): a collection of QuickTime components that allow you to play, import, and export Windows Media video and audio files on your Mac using your favorite QuickTime-based applications.
  * [Growl][15] (free): a notification system for Mac OS X.
  * [iTerm][16] (free): a full featured terminal emulation program.
  * [NeoOffice][17] (free): a free software port of [OpenOffice][18] to the MacOS X platform.
  * [OnyX][19] (free): it allows you to run misc tasks of system maintenance, to configure some hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock, Dashboard, Expos√©, Safari, Login window and of some of Apple&#8217;s own applications, to delete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome, to see the detailed info of your configuration, to preview various logs and CrashReporter-reports, to check the Preferences files and more.
  * [Parallels][20] (79.99$): enables you to run Windows, Linux, and more side-by-side with Mac OS X on any Intel-powered Mac, without rebooting (coherence mode is terrific!).
  * [Plazer][21] (free): a little piece of software that will help you make the most out of [Plazes][22].
  * [PocketMac for Blackberry][23] (free): to sync BlackBerry device with Entourage, Address Book, iCal, Now Contact, Now Up-To-Date, and even Stickies.
  * [QuickSilver][24] (free): a unified, extensible interface for working with applications, contacts, music, and other data.
  * [Skype][25] (free): free calls over the Internet.
  * [Textmate][26] (39$): a powerful tool for programmers, web designers, and anyone else who regularly needs to work with text files on Mac OS X.
  * [Transmit][27] (29.95$): FTP, SFTP, or TLS/SSL.
  * [Twitterrific][28] (free): a fun little application that lets you both read and publish posts or &#8220;tweets&#8221; to the [Twitter][29] community website.
  * [Visionary Saver][30] (free): Twittervision/Flickrvision and Twittervision 3D screen saver.
  * [VLC][31] (free): a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, &#8230;) as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols.
  * [XCode][32] (free): to create Mac OS X applications (It is bundled free with Mac OS X v10.4, though is not installed by default).

Anyway, as a Mac beginner user, your tips will be welcomed.

I&#8217;d recommend jUploadr rather than Flickr Uploader &#8211; it is far, far richer in function. other than that, I&#8217;m pretty much using the same stuff as you, except for those tools I don&#8217;t need (blackberry, Parallels, etc.).

You might find the Textmate book helpful.

And thanks for referencing my posts! I&#8217;m glad you found them useful.

I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/" rel="nofollow">iusethis.com</a> for a source of popular apps and such. Off the top of my list would be the Unsanity products <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/products" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, of course, as you&#8217;ve listed it already, <a href="http://www.flip4mac.com/wmv_download.htm" rel="nofollow">Flip4Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.grapefruit.ch/iBackup/" rel="nofollow">iBackup</a>, <a href="http://www.xheadsoftware.com/info_xhead.asp" rel="nofollow">info.xhead</a>, and another one by the Flip4Mac people, <a href="http://www.flip4mac.com/drivein.htm" rel="nofollow">Drive In</a>.
