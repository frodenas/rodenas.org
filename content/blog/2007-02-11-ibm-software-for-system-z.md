Two links only for [System z][1] developers:

  * Daniel Moul, Product Line Manager for [IBM WebSphere Studio Asset Analyzer][2], will conduct a webcast on February 21, 2007 about [Unleash the power of your existing mainframe assets into the SOA world][3].
  * Reginaldo Barosa, Senior Certified Application Development Specialist, will answer your questions about replacing the traditional TSO/ISPF development, connecting to z/OS, editing COBOL, PL1, or C/C++, and building, testing, and debugging batch or online programs and checking the results using [IBM WebSphere Developer for System z][4]. Submit your questions at the [Meet the experts: Question submission form][5]. **Updated 03/07/2007**: [Here are the answers][6].



BTW, I will never understand why System z tools pertains to the [WebSphere][7] brand and are not integrated in the [Rational][8] brand. They aren&#8217;t development tools?

Rational is the IBM brand for application development tools. WebSphere is the IBM brand for web application servers. But if your tool is an integral part of the WebSphere story, like something that directly leverages the server&#8217;s capabilities, then you may get the WebSphere brand even if you are a tool set. On the other hand, the difference may be due merely to historical naming. You&#8217;re not alone in your confusion though. There are a variety of ways to rectify the situation; however, in my opinion, product names change too frequently as it is.

David, thanks for your clarification. I have got this conversation with other IBMers and the conclusion is always the same: historical reasons (for example, prior to the IBM-Rational integration process) or just marketing.

I agree with you that, unfortunately, product names changes too frequently. The problem is when there are two or more sales departments and you are in the client side. Depending on the product you want to evaluate, you must call a WebSphere sales or a Rational Sales representative.
