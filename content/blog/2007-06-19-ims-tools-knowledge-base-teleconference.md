<img src='/blog/images/2007/06/ims.gif' alt='IMS' class="alignright" />IBM seems to continue to enhance [IMS][1] tooling set, this time with an autonomic management tool. [IMS Tools Knowledge Base][2] is a tool to assist <acronym title="DataBase Administrators">DBAs</acronym> to store, manage, and access reports generated from some selected IMS tools.

If you are interested in this tool, join the [The IMS Tools Knowledge Base: The foundation of IBM&#8217;s autonomic direction for IMS Tools][3] teleconference on June 26, 2007 to discuss with Joe Sacco, IMS Tools Project Manager, and Ronald Defalco, IMS Tools Senior Software Engineer, how to improve problem determination and resolution, consolidate islands of IMS tools data into one repository and build a foundation for better decision-making.
