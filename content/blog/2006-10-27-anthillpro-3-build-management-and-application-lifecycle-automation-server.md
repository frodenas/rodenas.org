[Urbancode][1] has announced the release of [AnthillPro 3][2], a build management and application lifecycle automation server.

Supporting a distributed server/agent architecture, AnthillPro3 allows for distributed and multi-platform builds, automated unit, functional, and performance tests, as well as deployments to multiple environments. An embedded workflow engine provides the ability to define consistent and automated processes that integrate with existing Change Management Systems as CVS, ClearCase, Harvest, PVCS, Perforce, Starteam, Subversion and VSS. Roles based security guarantees separation of responsibility and together with guaranteed traceability and built-in audit reports provides a compliance solution out of the box.

Usage scenarios includes Automated Build, Multi-platform Build, [Continuous Integration][3], Distributed Performance Tests, Dependency Management or Promotion and Deployment through QA, UAT, and PROD.
