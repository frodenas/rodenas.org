[alphaWorks Services][1], the emerging software services from IBM research and development labs, has launched a new service called [IBM Development Engagement Service][2]:

> IBMÂ® Development Engagement Service is a development environment for end users that focuses on form-based applications. Business users who have no programming skills can use IBM Development Engagement Service to create online forms.
> 
> Users start their development session by accessing a Web-based and highly-visual user interface (UI). The user proceeds through a series of wizard pages in order to specify details such as an application name, behaviour, look and feel, and the model for the form that is to be managed by the application.
> 
> After the user defines the application using the development UI, the definition is submitted to the IBM Development Engagement Service back-end where the application is constructed. At this point, the user receives a URL that he can use to access the application.

This new service, created by the [IBM Haifa Research Lab][3], is composed of two distinctive components:

  * An Ajax-based Web application component, where users access to the development environment and construct an application that implicitly defines a model.

  * The IBM Development Engagement Service back-end, that it exposes services such as data access, user profiles, application construction out of templates, and more.
