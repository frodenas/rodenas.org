      Nobody at OMG came to defend UML over DSM. The main argument given for using UML is that it is a standard! No problem if it is large and complex, canâ€™t be used for generating efficient code and leads to throwing away models at the end.

I spent multiple hours talking to people that are very frustated of UML as it does not address any specific domain needs. I also got feedback from an authority in modeling field that some organizations are dumping UML and not taking anything instead&#8230; We are going back in software engineering if this is what really is happening. DSM is not trying to replace UML, but to help organizations to be more effective in product-family development and code quality.

Petri, thanks for your comment.

Actually I&#8217;m analysing MDD methodologies and I&#8217;m arriving at the same conclusion about UML (or OMG MDA) and DSM. We (at my company) have some successful DSL implementations, mainly where we have a well-known and stabilized problem domain. But this doesn&#8217;t mean we are not using UML anywhere. We only use UML for documenting purposes, not for generating code.

BTW, Jack Greenfield, from Microsoft, has a nice article called <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/arcjournal/bb245772.aspx" rel="nofollow">Bared-Naked Languages or What Not to Model</a> that summarizes when and when not use UML or DSL.
