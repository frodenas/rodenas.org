[Josh Staiger][1] and [Bill Higgins][2], members of the [IBM Rational Jazz][3] Team, had announced that a new [Jazz.net][4] website is now online with some basic information about this project.

> Simplicity through consistency. Collaboration in context. Agility through transparency&#8230; Jazz is about helping people work together to build software more effectively, while making the software development experience more fun!
> 
> Jazz is a joint project between [IBM Rational][5] and [IBM Research][6] to build a scalable, extensible team collaboration platform for seamlessly integrating tasks across the software life cycle.
> 
> While this technology is at an early stage, it is an exciting and important part of Rational&#8217;s future.

The website doesn&#8217;t contain much information, just a [community page][7] with some upcoming events. It seems that people who attend to the Jazz <acronym title="Birds of a Feather">BoF</acronym> session at [EclipseCon 2007][8] will be eligible to join to a Jazz community pilot.

I will look forward to it, as more details are expected soon.
