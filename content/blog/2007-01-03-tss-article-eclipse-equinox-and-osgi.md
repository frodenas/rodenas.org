There is a new article at The Server Side about [Eclipse, Equinox and OSGi][1] which briefly describe what is [OSGi][2] and its implementation at the [Eclipse Equinox Project][3]. The authors are Jeff McAffer, who actually leads the Eclipse [Equinox OSGi][3], [RCP][4] and [Orbit][5] teams, and Simon Kaegi, from [Cognos][6].

I met Jeff at the [EclipseCon 2005][7], and with Jean-Michel Lemieux (a committer on the Eclipse Team/CVS), they gave me some valuable advices about the use of Eclipse RCP at financial applications, especially on branch teller applications. They both published a book titled [Eclipse Rich Client Platform][8].
