CodeGear, former [Borland Tools Unit][1], will release a new version of [JBuilder][2] later this quarter. This new version is completely rebuilt and re-architected to take advantage of [Eclipse 3.2][3]. It&#8217;ll have nice features as UML2, VisualEJB, OptimizeIt or Team development capabilities (more details at the [official announcement][4]).

Curiously, today I&#8217;ve received an [IBM developerworks email][5] remembering me that NOW is the best moment to consider [IBM Rational Application Developer][6]. Coincidence?
