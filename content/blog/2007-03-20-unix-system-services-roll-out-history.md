[Mark Cathcart][1] has posted a [nice article][2] about the [Unix System Services][3] roll-out process. He provides a historical overview of the decisions involved in the revitalization of the mainframe back in the early 90â€™s.

Personally, I remember when we introduced <acronym title="Unix System Services">USS</acronym> at my company about 8 years ago. It was a hard but also a funny work. Lots of mainframe guys dealing with a subsystem under [OS/390][4] that has a strange behaviour and terminology.

I also remember when I personally had to deal with [Rexx][6] and USS. We needed to implement a change control system to manage the production environment changes. Executing OpenEdition (USS former name) services through the &#8220;_Address Syscall_&#8221; Rexx instruction under a [TSO][7]/[ISPF][8] environment on a OS/390 mainframe was very very funny (and painful!).

I remember specially when one of our sysprogs executed the &#8220;_rm_&#8221; instruction on the development root filesystem using the change control user, which was, logically, a superuser. Just imagine his face when he realized what he has done! After this destructive action, we created an &#8220;_rm_&#8221; alias to prevent these kind of incidents.

Snif, I miss these great moments.
