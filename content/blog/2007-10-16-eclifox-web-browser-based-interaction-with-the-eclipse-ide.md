[alphaWorks][1], the IBM emerging technologies portal, has released a new [Eclipse][2] plug-in that sounds very interesting: [Web Browser-Based Interaction with the Eclipse IDE][3] (codename Eclifox or Eclipse Web Enabler). It is an Eclipse plug-in that enables [Gecko][4]-based browsers, like [Firefox][5], access to the Eclipse <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>.

> Browser-based access to an Eclipse IDE or an Eclipse-based application allows users to access Eclipse without any installation or configuration. Users can evaluate an application without downloading it. Alternatively, Eclipse can be accessed by multiple browser-based users. This application provides an opportunity for combining Eclipse content in mashups. 

Developed by 6 interims from the [SJCE][6] and guided by [Gautham B Pai][7] from the IBM India Software Lab, this plug-in converts Eclipse User Interface content, except for the ones created with <acronym title="Graphical Editing Framework">GEF</acronym> or visual editors, to <acronym title="XML User interface Language)">XUL</acronym> format, that it is served by a [Jetty web server][8] and then rendered in the Gecko browser.

Here it is an screenshot of the PHP plug-in viewed inside a Firefox browser:

And view this impressive [flash demo][9] that shows the usage of Python and Ruby plug-ins from Eclifox.

This is the second attempt I see to bring us a web browser IDE. The first one, who follows a different programming model based on [Ajax][10] and [REST][11], is the Web UI Foundation Component of the [Jazz Platform][12], which allows users to directly access a Jazz server from a web browser.

We shall be keeping an eye on them.
