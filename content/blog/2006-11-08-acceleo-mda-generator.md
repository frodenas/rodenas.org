Just discovered an opensource [MDA][1] code generator tool from [Obeo][2] called [Acceleo][3].

Features includes integration within [Eclipse][4], native use of [EMF][5], development environment (template editor with syntax highlighting, reflective editor, real time error detection, &#8230;), the ability to target any technology as it is based on the use of templates, and compatibility with XMI/UML 2.0 or 1.4, so you could integrate it with [Rational Software Modeler][6], [Poseidon][7] or [Topcased][8] among others.

In the documentation page, you will find a [quickstart guide][9] if you want to catch up with it.
