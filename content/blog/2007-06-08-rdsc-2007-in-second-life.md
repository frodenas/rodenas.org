This year I&#8217;m going to miss the [IBM Rational Software Development Conference 2007][1], but &#8230; only in real life, because for the first time, <acronym title="Rational Software Development Conference">RSDC</acronym> will also take place in [Second Life][2].

Check these <acronym title="Second Life">SL</acronym> URLs from June 10th to view the General Sessions, catch Rational product demonstrations, and interact with Rational experts: [IBM 5 Main Tent][3] and [IBM CodeStation][4].

And of course, if you want to know how is the real atmosphere at RDSC, Kelly Drahzal will be [live blogging][5] this event.
