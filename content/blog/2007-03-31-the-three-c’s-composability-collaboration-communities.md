I have found an interesting [presentation (PDF)][1] from IBM Distinguished Engineer [Sridhar Iyengar][2] given at the [6th IEEE International Conference on COTS-based Software Systems][3].

> The last few years has seen a great acceleration in the convergence of two communities &#8211; the open standards community that is setting a foundation for how global, interoperable software intensive systems can be specified and the open source community which is implementing many of these standards. As the pace of software complexity continues to accelerate &#8211; we are assembling and integrating software that is produced by a global community &#8211; new challenges are driving architectural innovation. How can we design these systems with composability in mind while at the same time improving the productivity & consumability (by architects as well as users) of the systems we deliver. The move towards Model Driven Architecture (MDA) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)- the &#8216;Architecture word is respectable now! &#8211; and many of the open source projects at eclipse.org and apache.org that implement these specifications clearly illustrate this trend. What is missing? &#8211; A focus on &#8216;consumability&#8217; : How can we use motivating scenarios from end users that drive the implementation of these standards as we continue our thirst for simplifying and managing software complexity. The talk will conclude with some late breaking information on how some of the key emerging MDA and SOA standards are converging and building a foundation for the next wave of standards & innovation in Business Process Management.

In this presentation, Sridhar points out some future projections about software development, he summarize the <acronym title="Object Management Group">OMG</acronym> history, from middleware focus (&#8217;89) through IT modeling focus (&#8217;02) to business & industry focus (&#8217;07), and he finalizes talking about the [Jazz project][4] (slides from the <acronym title="Rational Software Development Conference">RSDC</acronym> 2006), which tries to be the three C&#8217;s: composability (extensible platform), collaboration (enables development teams to collaborate in real time) and community (open source Jazz core infrastructure and open technologies).
