DexX has published a nice article called [Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ: Assessing the Survivors of the Java IDE Wars][1] where compares the latest versions of the major <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDEs</acronym> in the Java development space: [NetBeans][2], [Eclipse/MyEclipse][3], and [IntelliJ IDEA][4].

The article reviews the three major Java IDEs from the viewpoint of basic, common features, but if focuses more on their strengths in four common areas of development: Swing, JSP/Struts, JavaServer Faces, and J2EE/EJB 3.0.

In the last part of the article, the author warns about ignoring the next version of Microsoft Visual Studio (code named &#8220;[Orcas][5]&#8220;), because [Microsoft][6] is putting a massive amount of R&D effort in both libraries and development tools, although he believes none of the Java IDE vendors are getting too comfortable and resting on their laurels:

> I am very glad to see that the mistaken old Java mentality of &#8220;release the <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">APIs</acronym> first and then wait for the development tools of varying quality to appear much later&#8221; is being aggressively replaced with &#8220;release the APIs and world-class development tools for them as soon as possible&#8221;.
