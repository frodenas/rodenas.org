[SPRiNT-iT][1] and [InfoQ][2] have teamed to provide a new resource for Scrum teams: a downloadable quick-reference filled with basic definitions and checklists, intended to give trained teams confidence in accomplishing their first Sprints. You can [download your free copy or buy a printed version][3].
