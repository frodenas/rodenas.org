Starting December 23, a new initiative from the fun & leisure department at IBM Rational goes live: [IBM Rational Tube][1].

If you are a [RSDC 2007][2] registered member, you could post a 90 seconds video showing ‚ÄúWhat Keeps Me Rational‚Äù, as &#8220;that terrific Rational product or solution that saved you money, time, and possibly your sanity&#8221;. Participants will become eligible to win prizes and recognition at the upcoming conference (I&#8217;m imagining [Kelly][3] saying &#8220;and the Oscar goes to &#8230;&#8221;).
