      Alex Blewitt about Project Zero and Jazz. Wonder why is he using a so aggressive tone.

Mostly because it&#8217;s a really stupid idea, in my opinion. (At least, the Project Zero stuff, rather than Jazz). Seems that I&#8217;m not the only one with that opinion, even if it is more toned down elsewhere.

Alex, thanks for the explanation. I was not criticizing your opinion, it&#8217;s reasonable, although I believe that we must give them more time and see how the project evolves. I just was criticizing the tone of your post, as it is not usual in your writings.
