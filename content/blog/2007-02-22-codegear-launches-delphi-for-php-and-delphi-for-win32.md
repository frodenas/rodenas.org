I am confused by the name chosen &#8220;Delphi for PHP&#8221;. I thought that Delphi was (only) a language and mixing Delphi and PHP in the same tool denomination looks confusing for me.

You’re not alone in your confusion, but in fact, Delphi (former Turbo Pascal) is a <acronym title="Rapid Application Development">RAD</acronym> environment that includes, among others, the Delphi programming language (former Object Pascal). There is a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Delphi" rel="nofollow">article</a> at Wikipedia explaining this.
