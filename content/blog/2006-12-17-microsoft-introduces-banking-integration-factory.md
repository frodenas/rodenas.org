Through [Mike Walker&#8217;s blog][1], I just know that Microsoft has [announced][2] a new initiative, called &#8220;**Banking Integration Factory**&#8220;, that provides prescriptive architecture guidance, tools and reference implementations aimed at achieving consistency in banking integration. At the [MSDN Banking Industry Center][3] there are some articles describing it. It&#8217;s worth reading.
