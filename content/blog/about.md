Ferran &#8211; perhaps a stretch, but given your interest in areas of agility, wikis, etc., would love your input on our Enterprise 2.0 Survey, launched today (Monday, January 7, 2008) &#8211; give us your feedback! <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2b7qwl" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2b7qwl</a>

Cheers, Dan

Your blog is very impressive!

Wei, nice to hear from you and thanks for your comment! I hope you find the post about RDA helpful ðŸ˜‰

Hey, I stumbled on your blog tonight, nice work!

Just for fun, and to help ðŸ˜‰ In the above you say &#8220;To improve my written English skills (so if you find any mistake, Iâ€™ll appreciate you notify me via the contact form)&#8221;

More correctly, you would say &#8220;I would appreciate it if you notified me..&#8221; and you could abbreviate I would to I&#8217;d.

Finally, one more for you, it really doesn&#8217;t need the &#8220;Because&#8221; at the start of the two reasons&#8230;

Oh yes, English is such a subjective language.

### Comment by Mark Cathcart on 2008-05-31 12:16:12 +0000
Ahhh missed an obvious one. &#8220;if you find any mistake&#8221; should either be &#8220;mistakes&#8221; or &#8220;if you find a mistake&#8221; as mistake is singular.

Now must go pack&#8230;

Wow, I was warned that Brits living in the US became some kind of language Taliban, but I didn&#8217;t believe in this rumour until now ðŸ˜‰

Now seriously, Thanks Mark for your corrections! I&#8217;ve updated the page to reflect your suggestions. And thanks for dropping by! It&#8217;s an honour for me that someone like you read my blog.

PS: Good luck with your triathlon races!
