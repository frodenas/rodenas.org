[alphaWorks][1], the IBM emerging technologies portal, has launched today a new service: [QEDWiki][2].

> QEDWiki is &#8220;an environment that extends current [wiki][3] technology to enable rapid deployment, content aggregation, structured data, and powerful extensibility&#8221;.
> 
> QEDWiki can be used for a wide variety of Web applications, including, but not limited to, the following:
> 
>   * Web content management for a typical collection of Wiki pages
>   * traditional form processing for database-oriented <acronym title="Create/Read/Update/Delete">CRUD</acronym> applications
>   * document-based collaboration
>   * rich interactive applications that bind together disparate services
>   * situational applications (or mash-ups)

Technology community is invited to actively collaborate and participate in the development and direction of this emerging technology, so give it a chance and [try it now][4].

Although if you just want to see a demo, check this [YouTube Video][5] where David Barnes explains what is QEDWiki.
