Today, I have attended to a [developerWorks][1] chat, conducted by [Bill Higgins][2], about [Making the move to Ajax][3].

There were lots of IBM folks, as [Grady Booch][4], [Patrick Mueller][5], Matt Lavin, Bob Goodman and Gino Bustelo (leader and commiter on the AJAX Tools Framework) and Adam Peller (Dojo committer), as well as some software analyst as [Cote][6].

It was very interesing, mainly because the format, as you have the ability to interact with people doing innovative projects in Ajax. We talked about which toolkit/framework are most used, their strengths and weakness, which are the opinions on Ajax (and REST) at the very senior technical and mgmt. level, accessibility/standards (a11y and i18n), Microsoft strategy towards Ajax, openLaszlo or ATF/WTP JS editor plans.

If you could not attend the chat, you can read the [full transcript][7].

And remember that tomorrow, December 7, there will be another chat, where [Grady Booch][4] will lead an online discussion and answer your questions about the [new tools just released from IBM Rational][8]. More details at [Grady Booch answers your questions about this week&#8217;s Rational tools release][9].
