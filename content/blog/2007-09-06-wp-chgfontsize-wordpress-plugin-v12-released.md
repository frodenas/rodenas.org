I have updated the [WP-chgFontSize WordPress plugin][1] to fix a nasty bug:

  * Bug: first click on + size, it jump to GIANT font size.

You can download the new version v1.2 at the [WordPress Plugins Directory][2].

Hi there, nice site with good info. I really like coming back here often. There&#8217;s only one thing that annoys me and that is the misfunctioning of comment posting. I usually get to 500 error page, and have to do the post twice.
