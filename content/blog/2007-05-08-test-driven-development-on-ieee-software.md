The [May/June 2007 issue][1] (subscription required) of the [IEEE Software magazine][2] has a special section devoted to [Test Driven Development][3]:

> This special issue of IEEE Software includes seven feature articles on various aspects of TDD and a Point/Counterpoint debate on the use of mock objects in applying it. Notably, these articles demonstrate the ways TDD is being used in nontrivial situations (database development, embedded software development, GUI development, performance tuning). This signifies an adoption level for the practice beyond the visionary phase and into the early mainstream.
