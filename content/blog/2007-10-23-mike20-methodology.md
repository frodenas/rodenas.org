Via [Anant Jhingran][1] blog, today I discovered [MIKE2.0][2] (Method for an Integrated Knowledge Environment), a nice initiative from [BearingPoint][3] which aims to be a collaborative, open source methodology for [Enterprise Information Management][4] and to provide an organizing framework for [Information Development][5]:

> MIKE2.0 is a comprehensive methodology that can be applied across a number of different projects within the Information Management space, including those that apply to: Information Governance, Data Quality Improvement, Data Integration, Data Migration (once-off batch migration and parallel runs), Data Warehousing, Master Data Management and IT Transformation.

    I didn&#8217;t had time to review the wiki contents (I&#8217;ll do in the next few days ðŸ˜‰ ), but what I really appreciate is the fact that they are releasing most of their content using a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license and that they are using a collaborative model. Quoting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weinberger">David Weinberger</a>:

    They encourage every information management professional to join this open source community, to fully participate in this effort and to let them know what you think about the intellectual property they have shared. So if your job is related to the <acronym title="Information Management">IM</acronym> field, <a href="http://mike2.openmethodology.org/index.php/Main_Page">take a look</a> and share your opinions with them.
