[Grady Booch][1] will give a virtual lecture at the [IBM CODESTATION][2] Pavilion in [Second Life][3]. Make sure to [register][4] soon as virtual space is limited.

**Be aware that this lecture is not available in all countries**. And I don&#8217;t understand why, first notice that Second Life has frontiers.
