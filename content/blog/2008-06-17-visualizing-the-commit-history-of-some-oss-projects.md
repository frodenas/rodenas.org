Found this stunning experiment in organic software visualization on [Slashdot][1]:

<center>
  <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1130828"><img src="/blog/images/2008/06/eclipse_code_swarm.png" alt="A moment from the Eclipse project" title="code_swarm: Eclipse" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-298" /></a>

From the [project website][2]:

> This visualization, called code_swarm, shows the history of commits in a software project. A commit happens when a developer makes changes to the code or documents and transfers them into the central project repository. Both developers and files are represented as moving elements. When a developer commits a file, it lights up and flies towards that developer. Files are colored according to their purpose, such as whether they are source code or a document. If files or developers have not been active for a while, they will fade away. A histogram at the bottom keeps a reminder of what has come before.

Check some of these open source projects visualizations: [Eclipse][3], [Python][4], [PostgreSQL][5], and [Apache][6]. You&#8217;ll be amazed!
