A new site about Scrum: [Implementing Scrum][1]. What&#8217;s the difference with other scrum sites? As they stated, &#8220;Learning through humor&#8221;, adding comic strips to the articles.

Thanks for the recent blog about my site. I&#8217;d love feedback. Feel free to check out the new comic strip each week (usually by Monday afternoons) or subscribe via RSS or e-mails for updates.
