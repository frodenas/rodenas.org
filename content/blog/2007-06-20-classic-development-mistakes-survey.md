[Steve McConnell][1] has updated his original [list of classic development mistakes][2], ineffective development practices that have been chosen so often, by so many projects, with such predictable results.

Now, [Construx][3], the company founded in 1996 by Steve, is interested in the frequency and severity of each of these 42 classic mistakes in your experience. They plan to collate the results later this year and provide a summary report.

So go ahead and take the [survey][4].
