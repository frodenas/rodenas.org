IBM has opened a beta program for Quality Management solutions for testing <acronym title="Service Oriented Architecture">SOA</acronym> applications. It contains downloads for Rational Tester for SOA, which is powered by [IBM Rational Performance Tester][1] and IBM Rational Performance Tester Extension for SOA.

You can download the beta code at the [Rational software early programs][2] site, and a [developerWorks forum][3] is available for support.
