&#8220;[Taking the Rational Out of RUP][1]&#8220;, an article from [SD Times][2], explains how [Unified Process][3] is moving well beyond its roots, with the new [Essential Unified Process (EssUP)][4], a lightweight variation developed by [Ivar Jacobson][5], and [Open Unified Process (OpenUP)][6], the [Eclipse Process Framework][7] software development process.

Both sets of best practices are not simply variants, they have been written from the ground up, and they share a common goal of streamlining software development and moving agile practices in the mainstream

Others re-purposed methods not included in the article are [Agile Unified Process (AUP)][8], a simplified version by Scott Ambler, and [Enterprise Unified Process (EUP)][9], an extension of the RUP for enterprises.
