I don&#8217;t remember exactly the weather conditions, but certainly the October 15, 2006 was a gray and rainy day. I don&#8217;t find any other reasons to explain why I started this blog üôÇ

Seriously, today it is the first anniversary of this blog and that is something I am very proud of. I am sure that one year ago I didn&#8217;t imagine where this adventure will carry me. Now, I am satisfied with the results. I have learned a lot and, most important, I have connected with lots of others folks who share my same passion. [Kelly][1], [Luis][2] and [James][3] are, among others, the main responsible that today I am still maintaining this blog.

What happened during this last year? 182 posts and 100 comments (and 18,459 spam comments üôÅ ).

Although seeing the above image, I must admit that regularity is not my strength. I am sure [Twitter][4] and [del.icio.us][5] have something to do.

Hope that I will be able to post some more interesting articles about methodologies and tools. **THANKS all of you for reading this blog!**

Hi Ferdy! Wooohooo! A year already! My goodness! Time flies when you are having plenty of good fun! Thanks much for the kind comments and for the link love. I must say that I discovered your blog by following up on one of my IBM colleagues and got hooked from day one. So still hanging around here for a little while now. Don&#8217;t worry about the frequency. We actually know where you live and how we can find you üòâ heh

Just keep it up and I am sure one of these days we will have the opportunity to meet up face to face, like you have done with monkchips already. We have been pretty close, so I am sure it will come around! 

Here is to a few other years of successful blogging! Congrats again and keep it up! 

¬°Un abrazo!
