A couple of useful links:

  * A new WebSphere Technical Exchange Webcast, by Dan Zachary, will take place on 08 March 2007 at [11 AM EST (GMT-5)][1] about [CICS/DB2 Debugging Techniques][2]:
  
    > This presentation discusses ways to approach various types of problems involving the CICS/DB2 interface. Problems include transaction hangs and loops, transaction abends (e.g. abendAD2U), and connection/disconnection failures. Debugging approaches will primarily involve using dumps. 

  * A whitepaper about &#8220;[IBM WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Version 6: A performance report, white paper][3]&#8220;:
  
    > The information in this white paper is designed to provide a balance that can suit users of both System z mainframes, and J2EE technology-based WebSphere systems. Although the only accurate method of determining how a server might perform under a particular workload is to test the server within an environment suitable for that workload, this can be a very difficult and expensive proposition. IBM has documented a combination of primitive component tests, simple end-to-end tests, client proof-of-concept benchmarks and complex operational performance tests to assist you in planning for introducing WebSphere Application Server for z/OS workloads into your existing environments. Use this information to help you make an informed decision, but keep in mind that it is not a substitute for a detailed performance and capacity planning process.
