Borland Software [announced][1] that it will spin its developer tools group off into a wholly owned subsidiary known as [CodeGear][2], a new organization that will be 100% dedicated to the developer tools market. The reason is they did not believe any of the prospective suitors would be able to &#8220;reflect the core value of the asset.&#8221;

[Borland][3] has produced great tools. Hope this new company will continue the saga.
