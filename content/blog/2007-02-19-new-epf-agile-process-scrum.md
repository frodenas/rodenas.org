After [OpenUP/Basic][1] and [XP][2], now there is a third agile process available through the Eclipse Process Framework: [Scrum][3]. The content is in French, but there is an English Scrum version under way.

If it is the first time you hear about the [Eclipse Process Framework Project][4]:

> <acronym title="Eclipse Process Framework">EPF</acronym> aims at producing a customizable software process engineering framework, with exemplary process content and tools, supporting a broad variety of project types and development styles.

Besides the three process mentioned before, there is also a [DSDM][5] plugin in the review stage.
