Yes, I know I didn&#8217;t update this blog lately, but my father is in <acronym title="Intensive Care Unit">ICU</acronym> since December 20th with a [severe acute pancreatitis][1]. After 82 days and 5 surgeries, it seems he is recovering well, although his situation is still critical according to doctors. It has been a hard couple of months, very busy and stressful, so I didn&#8217;t have much time to update this blog nor to respond some comments. Sorry, I&#8217;ll do it in the next few weeks.

Anyway, as a distraction, I changed the blog theme (as you may have noticed) with a major makeover, since I was getting bored with the old one. Hopefully you‚Äôll like this one, I believe it is more readable now. And if you find any error, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.

Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be leaving for London to attend the [QCon 2008 conference][2]. So stay tuned, as I plan to live [blog][3] and [twitter][4] the event (as [last][5] [year][6]). If you are the same conference and would like to meet me, please come in and say hi!.
