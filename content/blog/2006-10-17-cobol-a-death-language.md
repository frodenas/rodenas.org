A recent survey, conducted by [Computerworld][1] at 352 companies, revealed that a lot of them are still using [Cobol][2] actively.

> &#8220;A lot of people have said they were going to get rid of the mainframe, but that hasn&#8217;t happened. And for us, all that code is working. There&#8217;s no sense in rewriting it.&#8221;

> &#8220;For years, pundits have said that the way to avoid the headaches of maintaining Cobol &#8211; and mainframes, green screens and other legacy paraphernalia &#8211; is to replace them. But that hasn&#8217;t happened, even in the massive Y2k remediation effort.&#8221;

But the most amazing fact of all is that **58% said they&#8217;re using it to develop new applications**. Viva Cobol!
