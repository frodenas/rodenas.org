Wow! After studying [Structured programming][1], [Object-oriented programming][2] and [Functional programming][3] for many years, today I&#8217;ve discovered a new programming discipline, the [Esoteric programming][4].

An esoteric programming language (aka _Esolang_) is a computer programming language designed to experiment with weird ideas, to be hard to program in, or as a joke, rather than for practical use. Below there are some examples of &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; programs written in this kind of languages:

  * [Brainfuck][5], which consist of only eight recognized characters:
  
    `++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]
>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<br />
<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.`
  * [Befunge][6], where programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid:
  
    `>              v<br />
v  ,,,,,"Hello"<
>48*,          v<br />
v,,,,,,"World!"<
>25*,@`

You&#8217;ll find the complete list at the [Esolang Community Portal][7].
